Java Map Interface
A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. Each key and value pair is known as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.

A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.


1}}HashMap
Points to remember
Java HashMap contains values based on the key.
Java HashMap contains only unique keys.
Java HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java HashMap is non synchronized.
Java HashMap maintains no order.
The initial default capacity of Java HashMap class is 16 with a load factor of 0.75.
		  HashMap<Integer,String> map=new HashMap<Integer,String>();//Creating HashMap    


Difference between HashSet and HashMap
HashSet contains only values whereas HashMap contains an entry(key and value).

2}}LinkedHashMap

Points to remember
Java LinkedHashMap contains values based on the key.
Java LinkedHashMap contains unique elements.
Java LinkedHashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java LinkedHashMap is non synchronized.
Java LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order.
The initial default capacity of Java HashMap class is 16 with a load factor of 0.75.
  LinkedHashMap<Integer,String> hm=new LinkedHashMap<Integer,String>();  


3}}TreeMap
Java TreeMap class is a red-black tree based implementation. It provides an efficient means of storing key-value pairs in sorted order.
The important points about Java TreeMap class are:

Java TreeMap contains values based on the key. It implements the NavigableMap interface and extends AbstractMap class.
Java TreeMap contains only unique elements.
Java TreeMap cannot have a null key but can have multiple null values.
Java TreeMap is non synchronized.
Java TreeMap maintains ascending order.

   TreeMap<Integer,String> map=new TreeMap<Integer,String>();    


        HashMap	                                          TreeMap
1) HashMap can contain one null key.	    TreeMap cannot contain any null key.
2) HashMap maintains no order.	          TreeMap maintains ascending order.

Java Hashtable class
Java Hashtable class implements a hashtable, which maps keys to values. It inherits Dictionary class and implements the Map interface.

Points to remember
A Hashtable is an array of a list. Each list is known as a bucket. 
The position of the bucket is identified by calling the hashcode() method. A Hashtable contains values based on the key.
Java Hashtable class contains unique elements.
Java Hashtable class doesn't allow null key or value.
Java Hashtable class is synchronized.
The initial default capacity of Hashtable class is 11 whereas loadFactor is 0.75.

  Hashtable<Integer,String> hm=new Hashtable<Integer,String>();
