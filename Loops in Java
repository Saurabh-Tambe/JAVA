Control Statements---
if statement
if-else statement
if-else-if ladder
nested if statement
Switch 

Loops-----
For
for(initialization;condition;incr/decr){  
//statement or code to be executed  
} 

while
while(condition){  
//code to be executed  
}  

do while
The Java do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop body.
do{  
//code to be executed  
}while(condition);  

#### Java for-each Loop
The for-each loop is used to traverse array or collection in java.
It is easier to use than simple for loop because we don't need to increment value and use subscript notation.
It works on elements basis not index. It returns element one by one in the defined variable.
  
  int arr[]={12,23,44,56,78};  
    //Printing array using for-each loop  
    for(int i:arr){  
        System.out.println(i);  
    }
    
    
    
Break----
    When a break statement is encountered inside a loop, 
    the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.
    The Java break statement is used to break loop or switch statement. 
    It breaks the current flow of the program at specified condition. In case of inner loop, it breaks only inner loop.
    
    
Continue---
The continue statement is used in loop control structure when you need to jump to the next iteration of the loop immediately. 
It can be used with for loop or while loop.
The Java continue statement is used to continue the loop. It continues the current flow of the program and skips the remaining 
code at the specified condition. In case of an inner loop, it continues the inner loop only
